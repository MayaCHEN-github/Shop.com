Shop.com - A CSCI3100 project by Group G5

This project is built using Vite for a faster build.
To start the project, run the following commands:
```
cd Shop.com // set 'current directory' to the project folder
npm i
npm run dev // To start development server.
``` 
As for the backend,
First start a new terminal. 
Here, 
1. Set `cd` to the `server` folder, then
2. Enter `nodemon server` to start server. (or simple `node server` works just as fine)

Bootstrap, ExpressJS and Mongoose have been included as dependencies
